#### Introduction
This repository was showcased at Neoland's Data Science Bootcamp in April 2020. Exploring the application of variable analysis and machine learning technique for a classification task. with the first iteration using a logistic regression model and the second a XGBoost decision tree model.

### About the problem to solve:

The client is a large multinational company which have 9 broad verticals (different services) across the organization. The problem they are facing is around iden

Currently the process they are following is: They first identify a set of employees based on recommendations/ past performance Selected employees go through the separate training and evaluation program for each vertical. These programs are based on the required skill of each vertical

At the end of the program, based on various factors such as training performance, KPI completion (only employees with KPIs completed greater than 60% are considered) etc., employee gets promotion For above mentioned process, the final promotions are only announced after the evaluation and this leads to delay in transition to their new roles. Hence, company needs your help in identifying the eligible candidates at a particular checkpoint so that they can expedite the entire promotion cycle.

They have provided multiple attributes around Employee's past and current performance along with demographics. Now, The task is to predict whether a potential promotee at checkpoint in the test set will be promoted or not after the evaluation process.

While the original problem is directed to a given train and test datasets, my own project is more directed to the analysis of each variable.
